Wait all GPUs to finish their job...
All GPUs have finished their simulation job! Collecting dose...

Total batch number = 32
D>50%*Dmax region occupies 0.3% all voxels, with average uncertainty = 3.3%
Accumulated history number in dose file = 1015808
The dose file named <gSourceHead\BatchMode\example\gZeus.dose> has been generated ^_^
Time statistics for main GPU:
Total kernel time = 14.9 s
Total source time = 15.7 s
Mixed running time = 0.5 minutes, total history number = 1015808
The overall simulating speed = 31861 hist/sec
