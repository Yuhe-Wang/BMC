Wait all GPUs to finish their job...
All GPUs have finished their simulation job! Collecting dose...

Total batch number = 137
D>50%*Dmax region occupies 1.0% all voxels, with average uncertainty = 0.011767
Accumulated history number in dose file = 1006717
The dose file named <gFree\BatchMode\example\gZeus.dose> has been generated ^_^
Time statistics for main GPU:
Total copy time =-1.00
Total kernel time = 0.3 s
Total SourceHead time = 7.9 s

Mixed running time = 0.2 minutes, total history number = 1006717
The overall simulating speed = 91949 hist/sec

End log time = Tue Aug  8 17:32:21 2017
