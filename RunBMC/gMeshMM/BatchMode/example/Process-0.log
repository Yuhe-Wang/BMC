Penelope tries to load material files generated last time...
Make sure that EMax and material parameters weren't changed! 

It costs 0.170089 seconds to init GPU 
Warning: cannot get couch density factor in config file; will not modify the couch density!

It costs 0.012191 seconds to load phantom 

Calculating dose, please wait patiently...

Wait all GPUs to finish their job...
All GPUs have finished their simulation job! Collecting dose...


Total batch number = 9
D>50%*Dmax region occupies 0.2% all voxels, with average uncertainty = 10.8%
Accumulated history number in dose file = 1083598
The dose file named <gMeshMM\BatchMode\example\PENELOPE.dose> has been generated ^_^

Wait for the source generating thread to finish...
Source reuse times = 1

Time statistics for main GPU:
Total copy time =0.09 s
Total kernel time = 17.83 s
Total SourceHead time = 6.25 s

Mixed running time = 0.32 minutes, total history number = 1.0836e+06
The overall simulating speed = 56806 hist/sec
